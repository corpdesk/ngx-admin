      <h4>So what's About the grammar?</h4>
      <p>
        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries <strong>Vokalia</strong> and
        <strong>Consonantia</strong>,
        there live the blind texts.
        They live in <strong>Bookmarksgrove</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small <strong>river named Duden</strong> flows by their place and supplies it with the
        necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
        into your mouth.
        Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
        unorthographic life One day however a small
        line of blind text by the name of
        <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a> decided to leave for
        the far <strong>World of Grammar</strong>.
